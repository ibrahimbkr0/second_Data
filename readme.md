## 📌 Task #2: Creating the Readme.md File

This document details the Git commands I used, the differences between a local Git workflow and a GitHub workflow, the challenges I encountered, my decision-making process for commits, and how AI assisted me throughout the process.

## 🛠 Git Commands I Used

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository from GitHub
git clone <repo_url>

# Stage changes for commit
git add <file>

# Commit staged changes with a message
git commit -m "message"

# Push committed changes to the remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch <branch_name>

# Switch to a specific branch
git checkout <branch_name>

# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <branch_name>
```

## 🔄 Local Git Workflow vs. GitHub Workflow

### 🏠 My Local Git Workflow:
- I made code changes locally.
- I staged changes using `git add`.
- I committed changes using `git commit`.
- My repository remained local until I pushed it to a remote repository.

### ☁️ My GitHub Workflow:
- I pushed my changes to GitHub using `git push`.
- I collaborated with others through pull requests and code reviews.
- I merged branches via the GitHub UI or `git merge`.
- I pulled updates from the remote repository using `git pull`.

## ⚠️ Challenges I Encountered
- Understanding the difference between local and remote repositories.
- Resolving merge conflicts when working with multiple branches.
- Remembering the correct order of Git commands to avoid errors.
- Managing staged and unstaged changes efficiently.

## ✅ When I Decided to Make a Commit
I made commits at key moments, including:
- After adding a significant feature or fixing a bug.
- Before pulling changes from the remote repository.
- After resolving merge conflicts to maintain a stable state.
- Before switching branches to prevent losing progress.
